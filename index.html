      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
      dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
      It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
      popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            I was a research assistant in a research project that looked in digitizing calibration certificates.
            My tasks included documenting, semantics and React + JS basics used for web development.
            I also learned to take in large amounts of information as I joined the project after the start.
